# COMPLETE-898-Pokemon-Pokedex-

This is the complete (898 Pokémon) Pokédex built using PokéAPI - HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. 

I built this entire Pokédex myself, through destructuring data from PokéAPI and using lots of loops to produce 898 unique entries.

Each Pokémon can be clicked/tapped to reveal their base stats as well as a fun Pokédex description from the games!

You can also scroll back to the top of the application easily by clicking the up arrow button that will appeasr after you have scrolled a certain distance down.

Additionally, you can search multiple Pokémon using the search functionality that I built.

This was a 1 month - 1.5 month long project that I wanted to build for myself. I hope you enjoy it!
